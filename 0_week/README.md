# Week 0

## C++ Code Files
- These files always end with a `.cpp` extension
- ALWAYS SAVE your files - use `Ctrl-s` or `Cmd-s` to save the file

## Terminal
- `ls` - list - command to show contents in the folder 
- `cd` - change directory - command to change to a different directory
    - `..` means parent directory
    - `.` means current directory
    Example in the terminal:
    `cd subdirectory`
    `cd ../parents_subdirectory`
- the up arrow - run commands that you have run previously in the terminal
